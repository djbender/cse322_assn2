Part1:
$ lex assn2-part1.l 
$ cc yy.lex.c -ll -o part1 
$ ./part1

Makefile included is for part 2:
$ make
$ make clean
For my debugging purposes:
$ make debug 
Run executable:
$ ./trains


Assumptions:
1. All start and end tags have no spaces in them.
2. Cost must be at least one

Notes:
1. I have no idea how to grab the token that broke the grammar =(
